# Compact-Design-of-MIMO-Antenna-for-5G-Mobile
Multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) technology is one of the most promising technologies in the upcoming 5G mobile communication. A compact 4×4 MIMO antenna system is proposed to operate between 3.43.6 GHz (centred around 3.5 GHz) for future fifth-generation (5G) technology mobile broadband services. Initially, a single element antenna has been embedded on a mobile terminal and its performance has been tested based on some simulation studies. The proposed antenna is radiating in the desired frequency band and is expected to reduce the mutual coupling between the antenna elements. The antenna offers about 30% impedance bandwidth.
